# GaussianRandomSurface
This code generates a random surface roughness pattern by modeling the surface as a superposition of sinusoidal components with random phases, using a Fourier-based approach. The surface is defined over a specified spatial domain, with parameters controlling the size (`x_span`, `y_span`), roughness (`sigma_rms`), and correlation lengths (`corr_length_x`, `corr_length_y`) in the x and y directions. The surface is created in the frequency domain (k-space), where random phase shifts are applied, and the resulting frequency components are multiplied by a Gaussian correlation function to introduce spatial correlations. The inverse Fourier transform is then applied to obtain the surface in real space, and the surface heights are normalized to have a unit RMS value before scaling to the desired roughness. After generating the surface, the code analyzes the surface by dividing it into smaller subsections and computing the RMS roughness for each subsection, producing a roughness matrix. Additionally, surface profiles are extracted along the x and y axes at the origin (x=0, y=0), which represent height variations along these directions. The results are displayed in a set of subplots: the first subplot shows the height map of the surface, the second shows the RMS roughness matrix for the subsections, and the third and fourth plots show the surface profiles along the x and y directions, respectively, providing a comprehensive visualization of the surface’s roughness characteristics.
